They will be enabled by default when they are dragged into the window.

Fabric API allows mods to be loaded. Sodium works similar to Optifine. Iris allows shaders to be used with Fabric. Logical zoom is a tool that can be bound to any key for the ability to zoom in sort of like using binoculars. Plasmo Voice enables the proximity voice chat.

If you have any resource packs or shaders you would like to use, you can drag the zip folders for them into the respective sections of the "Edit" window.

Launch the instance. It may take some time for it to do it's initial launch. If it gets hung for over 5 minutes, close it and retry the launch.
